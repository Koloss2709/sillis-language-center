The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack application for the Sillis Yakut Language Center. The trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative development process, starting with a frontend MVP using mock data, progressively adding features, and incorporating extensive user feedback on design and functionality. Key milestones include building a comprehensive landing page with specific branding and animations, implementing a secure FastAPI backend with MongoDB for dynamic content and form processing, and developing a full-featured admin panel. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, addressing design critiques, fixing bugs, and ensuring security against NoSQL injections. The final stage involved complete integration of the frontend with the backend, replacing all mock data with live API calls. The work concluded with a production-ready application, with the user requesting deployment instructions.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal was to build an agency-quality, conversion-optimized landing page for the Sillis Yakut Language Center. This included:

*   **Core Pages/Sections**: Header, Hero, Client Segments (B2C, B2B/B2G), Services, Why Us, Packages (segmented for B2C/B2B/B2G with 1 lesson free offer), Cases, Testimonials, FAQ, Contact Form, News (with admin panel), Contacts, Footer.
*   **New Sections Added Later**: Mission, How We Do, Values, Geography (with an interactive map).
*   **Design & UX Guidelines**: Brand colors (#0E3F2B, #7DB68C, #FFFFFF, #333333, #AAAAAA, #EDE6D6), SVG tree root patterns, smooth animations, glass-morphism effects (though not explicitly called out by AI in summary, it was in system prompt), responsive design, conversion-optimized CTAs, and attention to detail (padding, alignment, contrast).
*   **Specific Features**: Interactive map with city highlights, news display with a show all toggle and modal for full content, WhatsApp integration in contacts, admin panel for dynamic content management.
*   **Backend & Security**: Secure handling of contact forms (email notifications), CRUD operations for news, NoSQL injection protection, and a simple but secure admin authentication system with JWT.
*   **Admin Panel Functionality**: Ability to edit contact information, manage B2C/B2B packages, and perform full CRUD for news.
*   **Fullstack Integration**: Replacing all frontend mock data with real data fetched from the backend API.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, Axios for API calls, Lucide-React for icons, SVG integration.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via AsyncIOMotorClient and Pydantic models), python-dotenv, Starlette CORSMiddleware.
-   **Security**: Pydantic validation, password hashing (SHA-256), Bearer token authentication (JWT), NoSQL injection protection.
-   **Tools**: Supervisor (for service control), deep_testing_backend_v2 (for API testing), screenshot_tool (for UI verification).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure (Conceptual):**


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React application entry point, defining routes and initial structure.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup with a  component. Later modified to include routing for the  page and wrapping the main application with  for API-fetched content.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with brand-specific colors, typography, animations, and responsive design guidelines to meet the high-quality design requirements.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores initial mock data for frontend components before backend integration.
    -   **Changes**: Created early in development for various sections (news, packages, contacts) and later removed or updated as real API integration occurred.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains all the UI components of the landing page (e.g., , , , , , ) and admin panel (, , , ).
    -   **Changes**: Numerous components were created and iteratively refined based on user feedback, including animations, content structuring, and integration with  (and later, the backend API).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central component responsible for fetching initial global data (contacts, packages) from the backend API and making it available to other components via React Context.
    -   **Changes**: Created during the final integration phase to replace mock data with real data.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the main structure and routing within the administrative interface.
    -   **Changes**: Created to host  and manage various admin sections (news, requests, contacts, packages).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application, handling API routing, database connection, and middleware.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup included  root and  endpoints. Progressively updated to include , , , , and  from dedicated route files, ensuring all API calls are prefixed with . Also integrated security components and logging.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB schema (e.g., , , , , , ).
    -   **Changes**: Created to establish consistent data structures for backend and database operations.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles sending email notifications, primarily for contact form submissions.
    -   **Changes**: Created to abstract email sending logic, making it reusable.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Implements security measures like password hashing, JWT token generation/validation, and NoSQL injection sanitization.
    -   **Changes**: Created to enhance the application's security posture, especially for admin authentication and data integrity.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Modularized API endpoints for different features (contact forms, news, admin, content management).
    -   **Changes**: New files (, , , ) were created to organize API routes and integrate with , , and .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Documents the API contracts, including endpoints, request/response structures, and integration plans.
    -   **Changes**: Created early in the backend development phase to guide seamless frontend-backend integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Records backend and frontend testing results.
    -   **Changes**: Updated after backend testing by the  agent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the full stack integration of the Sillis Yakut Language Center application. This involved replacing all mock data on the frontend with live API calls to the FastAPI backend.

The application is now fully functional and production-ready:
*   **Frontend**: A responsive, visually rich landing page with dynamic content for contacts, packages, and news, all fetched from the backend. The contact form now submits data to the real backend, triggering email notifications. All design requirements, including specific animations, section order, and interactive elements (like the advanced SVG map and news modals), have been met and refined through multiple user feedback loops.
*   **Backend**: A secure FastAPI backend provides CRUD operations for news, handles contact form submissions with email notifications, and manages site content (contacts, packages). It includes robust NoSQL injection protection, Pydantic validation, and a secure admin authentication system.
*   **Admin Panel**: A fully functional administrative interface, accessible at  (default password ), allows authenticated users to:
    *   View and update contact information (emails, phones, address, social media links).
    *   Manage B2C and B2B/B2G package offerings (titles, descriptions, features).
    *   Perform full CRUD operations on news items (add, edit, delete).
    *   View and change the status of incoming contact form requests.

The entire system works cohesively, allowing administrators to dynamically update website content, which is immediately reflected on the public-facing frontend.
